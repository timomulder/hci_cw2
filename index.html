                    <br><br><strong>What if I don’t meet one of my conditions or requirements?</strong>
                    <br>
                    This really depends on the condition and how off you were from meeting it. You should contact
                    admissions at: sciengmail@ed.ac.uk to check.


                    <br><br><strong>Can a conditional offer become unconditional?</strong>
                    <br>
                    Once the conditions on your offer have been met your offer becomes unconditional after you upload
                    the relevant evidence that your conditions have been met to your application.


                    <br><br><strong>After accepting my offer what do I do?</strong>
                    <br>
                    If you have uploaded all the evidence that you have met the requirements, if applicable, then you
                    shouldn’t have to do anything further.


                    <br><br><strong>I can’t afford to come, what can I do?</strong>
                    <br>
                    A lot of the internal scholarship deadlines from the University itself have passed. You should contact
                    studentfunding@ed.ac.uk and also seek external funding.


                    <br><br><strong>I want to study in America next year, but a lot of the semesters start in August, will I be able to attend?</strong>
                    <br>
                    You cannot be enrolled at two Universities at once, you should contact admissions at:
                    sciengmail@ed.ac.uk to confirm that your degree will be completed by this point.


                    <br><br><strong>I missed the UCAS deadline for confirming my offer, what can I do?</strong>
                    <br>
                    You should contact admissions immediately on +44(0)131 650 5753 to confirm.


                    <br><br><strong>Can I defer my offer a year?</strong>
                    <br>
                    This is widely dependent on your course, some have a 0 tolerance policy, but some allow the
                    possibility. You should check your course on the University website as well as contacting admissions
                    at: sciengmail@ed.ac.uk


                    <br><br><strong>When will I hear about my CAS number and the progress on my application?</strong>
                    <br>
                    If you haven’t heard back yet they are still processing your application. If you seek to find out the
                    progress of your application, contact: immigrationcompliance@ed.ac.uk


                    <br><br><strong>I’m looking to lease a flat/rent a room in one, what areas are best to look for flats in?</strong>
                    <br>
                    The main student areas are Newington, Marchmont, Bruntsfield and Quartermile. Newington is a
                    good option if you want to be right next to campus with reasonably priced flats. Quartermile is also
                    right next to the campus, but is a lot more expensive. Marchmont and Bruntsfield are a bit further
                    away (10-25 minute walk depending) but are generally nicer flats than Newington.


                    <br><br><strong>Who should I contact with questions about private accommodation?</strong>
                    <br>
                    The phone number and email to contact are:
                    Tel: +44(0)131 651 2113
                    Email: Gemma.Gilmour@ed.ac.uk
                    Direct any queries you may have here. 



                    <br><br><strong>When should I pay tuition fees?</strong>
                    <br>
                    You can pay before or at matriculation. The deadline is seen as the 3rd of October, but you can set up
                    your payment plan when you arrive.


                    <br><br><strong>Do I get a discount for paying my tuition fees all at once?</strong>
                    <br>
                    The answer is sadly no, there is no discount.


                    <br><br><strong>Should I open a UK bank account?</strong>
                    <br>
                    Yes, it’s just a lot easier as international bank accounts can have payment fees and other
                    complications. Santander are known to have good student accounts and there is a Santander
                    building right on campus.


                    <br><br><strong>What sort of laptop should I get?</strong>
                    <br>
                    This is completely up to personal preference. If you have concerns over work, I’ve been informed
                    that laptops that are 10 years old are still able to run programming languages completely fine. The
                    only other considerations are personal ones, such as how much money you’re willing to spend,
                    whether you like to play games etc.


                    <br><br><strong>What happens if I’m a few marks below the requirements for my ielts?</strong>
                    <br>
                    Unfortunately it is very unlikely that anything can be done. Meeting your ielts results is mandatory in
                    order to come to the University.


                    <br><br><strong>Applying for a Visa, but I haven’t heard about my accommodation so can’t put down a UK address?</strong>
                    <br>
                    As far as I’m aware, you don’t need a UK address in order to apply for a Visa. You should fill out this
                    enquiry form: http://www.ed.ac.uk/international-office/immigration/enquiry-form and also contact
                    immigrationcompliance@ed.ac.uk


                    <br><br><strong>Are there any part-time jobs with Informatics?</strong>
                    <br>
                    No, the University offers a wide variety of part-time jobs via EUSA, which can be seen on their
                    website: https://www.eusa.ed.ac.uk/jobs


                    <br><br><strong>Are their student loans within the UK for international students?</strong>
                    <br>
                    As far as I’m aware you have to seek loans from within your own country.


                    <br><br><strong>Can I take a course whilst at the University instead of taking ielts?</strong>
                    <br>
                    The answer is sadly no, there are some programmes like this on offer in some places, but this isn’t
                    possible with the University at this moment.


                    <br><br><strong>Admissions haven’t gotten back to me yet, is this normal?</strong>
                    <br>
                    Yes, they are dealing with 1000’s of students all with their on enquiries and it can take them some
                    time to get back to you. I know this is annoying and hope that you can have some patience. 



                    <br><br><strong>Can I pay accommodation fees in instalments?</strong>
                    <br>
                    Yes, if you want more information you can contact accommodation services at:
                    accom.rentenquiries@ed.ac.uk


                    <br><br><strong>What is the academic year for accommodation?</strong>
                    <br>
                    Your accommodation will be from September until just after your exams, which for most people are
                    May. Again you can contact them for more detailed answers at: accom.allocations@ed.ac.uk


                    <br><br><strong>Do postgraduates have a fresher’s week?</strong>
                    <br>
                    Yes Postgrads have what is officially called a ‘Welcome Week’ just as Undergrads are.


                    <br><br><strong>What happens to tuition fees with EU referendum result to Brexit?</strong>
                    <br>
                    Information regarding this can be found at,
                    Undergrads: http://www.ed.ac.uk/news/eu/applicants/undergraduate-applicants
                    Postgrads: http://www.ed.ac.uk/news/eu/applicants/postgraduate-applicants


                    <br><br><strong>What do you personally think of this accommodation?</strong>
                    <br>
                    I am happy to give my opinion on any accommodation you are looking into, but will stress that you
                    are the one that knows your own budget and how much you are willing to spend on accommodation,
                    meaning I’m reluctant to essentially decide for you.


                    <br><br><strong>What bank is best for me to open an account with?</strong>
                    <br>
                    This will require personal research in order to find the bank that’s best for you.
                    EUSA have a page dedicated to banking advice:
                    https://www.eusa.ed.ac.uk/.../mon.../money_management/banks
                    Another helpful sight: http://www.moneysavingexpert.com/stu.../Student-bank-account


                    <br><br><strong>When do I find out about accommodation?</strong>
                    <br>
                    If you have a conditional offer, you should find out after your conditions have been met and proven
                    to the University. Otherwise you should have already found out or finding out soon.
                    If you’re worried at all, then contact accommodation services at: accom.allocations@ed.ac.uk


                    <br><br><strong>Is it okay if I don’t drink at University?</strong>
                    <br>
                    Yes, lots of people don’t drink at Uni. I have friends that for whatever reasons, religious or the fact
                    they just don’t like it, don’t drink. It’s still possible to have fun and even go out without drinking.


                    <br><br><strong>How much should I spend on food a week?</strong>
                     (Catered Halls should ignore)<br>
                    This really depends on how much you eat and what you like to eat. A lot of students and what I
                    personally do is do big food shops, I like doing this online with ASDA or Tesco. Especially online you
                    can get good offers from supermarkets, I spend about £40 a food shop, which will generally last me 3
                    weeks.



                    <br><br><strong>Can we join research teams like the robot football one?</strong>
                    <br>
                    It’s very competitive to get on research groups such as this and would be more common for
                    postgraduate students to be involved.


                    <br><br><strong>When should I move to Edinburgh?</strong>
                    <br>
                    The recommended moving date is the 12th of September in time for Welcome Week


                    <br><br><strong>When will I hear about accommodation after I reach my conditions?</strong>
                    <br>
                    Unfortunately I can’t give you a specific time-scale, but they should get back to you shortly. If you’re
                    worried contact accommodation services at accom.allocations@ed.ac.uk


                    <br><br><strong>Do I have to choose one of the suggested university specialist areas for my other courses?</strong>
                    <br>
                    No you do not


                    <br><br><strong>Is it possible for me to change my master’s programme after the academic year begins?</strong>
                    <br>
                    Yes this should be fine


                    <br><br><strong>Deadline for ielts?</strong>
                    <br>
                    There is no firm deadline for ielts, but you should get it done by the end of this month to sort out
                    other aspects of coming to the Uni such as accommodation.
                    In my first year can I take outside courses that aren’t within Informatics if I’m doing a joint


                    <br><br><strong>degree?</strong>
                    <br>
                    Yes, in first year you have to make up 120 credits and most of the time you will have room for an
                    extra 40 credits.


                    <br><br><strong>Can I obtain my driver’s licence on a student visa?</strong>
                    <br>
                    You will need to contact the international office: http://www.ed.ac.uk/international-office/contactus
                    Also you can look at these websites:
                     First drivers license: https://www.gov.uk/apply-first-provisional-driving-licence
                     Driving in the UK on a non-UK drivers license: https://www.gov.uk/driving-nongb-licence
                     Exchanging a foreign driver’s license: https://www.gov.uk/exchange-foreign-driving-licence


                    <br><br><strong>When is the accommodation deadline (postgraduate)?</strong>
                    <br>
                    31st of July is the official deadline for accommodation if you want a guaranteed place offered.


                    <br><br><strong>Any accommodation for couples?</strong>
                    <br>
                    You can look into private accommodation offers, if you want any specific information contact
                    accom.allocations@ed.ac.uk


                    <br><br><strong>How long will it take the Uni to get back to me after sending my results in?</strong>
                    <br>
                    I can’t give a specific time for this either, they are very busy and will get back to you in time. If you
                    are worried you can contact admissions at sciengmail@ed.ac.uk


                    <br><br><strong>I’m short of one of my conditions by 1%, what should I do Will I be okay?</strong>
                    <br>
                    You should contact admissions at sciengmail@ed.ac.uk and upload your results to your application.
                    If you have missed your condition by such a small margin then you should be okay, but you will need
                    to check.


                    <br><br><strong>Can I defer a year?</strong>
                    <br>
                    You should check your course details on the University website to see if this is a potential option for
                    you as some degrees do not allow it. You should also contact admissions at sciengmail@ed.ac.uk


                    <br><br><strong>Is there a monthly ticket system for transport in Edinburgh, such as the buses?</strong>
                    <br>
                    There is, but you will most likely not need it as most places in Edinburgh where students go are easy
                    to walk to


                    <br><br><strong>Are there café’s on campus?</strong>
                    <br>
                    There are a few University owned cafes on campus. Potterow have one, Teviot the student union
                    have another and then there is the library café and David Hume Tower cafes.


                    <br><br><strong>How much are laundry prices in halls?</strong>

                    It normally costs £1 to use the washing machine and £1 for the tumble dryer if you are to use it. 


                    <br><br><strong>Is there a possibility to change degrees when I come to the Uni Would I also be able to move from a single degree to a joint or vice versa?</strong>
                    <br>
                    You should be able to change degrees no problem when you arrive. Similarly from switching to a
                    joint degree or changing to a single should also be okay.


                    <br><br><strong>Where are lectures given if not in the Forum?</strong>
                    <br>
                    Forest Hill is where you are going to be taught.



                    <br><br><strong>Do I need to upload a copy of my ielts certificate?</strong>
                    <br>
                    Yes you should upload proof of your ielts certificate to your application when you are able.


                    <br><br><strong>I was granted deferred entry, but I never requested this, what do I do?</strong>
                    <br>
                    This is quite a serious mistake and you should call admissions at +44(0)131 650 5753 and sort it out.


                    <br><br><strong>I’m waiting to hear if I’m being accepted as I fell sort of my conditions, what do I do?</strong>
                    <br>
                    You can’t do anything apart from wait and see if you are going to be accepted unfortunately.


                    <br><br><strong>Is there anything I can do once I am rejected from the Uni?</strong>
                    <br>
                    You can’t do anything else unfortunately, the decision is most likely final.


                    <br><br><strong>I’m from Edinburgh, how likely am I to be granted university accommodation?</strong>
                    <br>
                    Depending on where you live you can have quite a high chance. I know several people that are from
                    Edinburgh who stayed in halls.


                    <br><br><strong>How long will it take for me to get my unconditional after I submit the relevant documents?</strong>
                    <br>
                    Unfortunately there is no telling how much time, it can be days or weeks until you hear back as
                    admissions are very busy. If you are particularly busy you should contact admissions at
                    sciengmail@ed.ac.uk


                    <br><br><strong>What if I need my offer for a visa?</strong>
                    <br>
                    You can call them on +44(0)131 650 5753 and see if you can have the process sped up.

                    GENERAL INFORMATION REGARDING TURKEY:
                    At least one conditional offer holder for 2016/17 entry domiciled in Turkey has contacted the
                    University to advise that during/following the attempted coup, their IELTS test was cancelled and to
                    ask if we can accept or provide an alternative means of assessing them.
                    I have spoken to the British Council who have advised that any applicants whose test was cancelled,
                    should have received a communication from their test centre to advise them of an alternative date
                    and that IELTS testing in Turkey should be proceeding as normal going forward.
                    However, if Schools are contacted by applicants who claim to have experienced difficulties accessing
                    a test, and after asking to see the communication from the applicant’s test centre, it is deemed
                    appropriate for us to provide support for English testing, English Language Education (ELE), as per
                    support for Syrian applicants, have kindly agreed to offer remote testing of applicants as an alternative
                    method of evidencing competency, provided numbers are manageable.
                    School(s) should send ELE the following information for any applicants as appropriate:
                    · Student name
                    · Student UUN
                    · Contact email address
                    · Name of programme
                    · Current English level, if known
                    · English language requirements
                    ELE will then contact the applicant to arrange for a test to be carried out.
